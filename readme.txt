== Description == 

The simplest way to add Google+1 Buttons to your WordPress blog. 
And now you can post directly from G+ to your WordPress website. The Google+ plugin supports post formats so you can use a hashtag system to decide which post format you want your G+ post to appear as. 

It also includes BuddyPress support - post straight from your G+ profile or page to your activity stream. This is a fantastic option for people who run their own BuddyPress community and have a Google+ Page for it. Post to G+ and watch it appear on BuddyPress. Make your life easier, and amaze your community members at the same time. 

All you need to do is install and activate the plugin.  It's ready to go right away!
